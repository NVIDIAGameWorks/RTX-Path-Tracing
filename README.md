# Path Tracing SDK v1.3.0

![Title](./images/r-title.png)


## Overview

Path Tracing SDK is a code sample that strives to embody years of ray tracing and neural graphics research and experience. It is intended as a starting point for a path tracer integration, as a reference for various integrated SDKs, and/or for learning and experimentation.

The base path tracing implementation derives from NVIDIA’s [Falcor Research Path Tracer](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), ported to approachable C++/HLSL [Donut framework](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/donut).

GTC presentation [How to Build a Real-time Path Tracer](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?tab.catalogallsessionstab=16566177511100015Kus&search.industry=option_1559593201839#/session/1666651593475001NN25) provides a high level introduction to most of the features.


## Features

* DirectX 12 and Vulkan back-ends
* Reference and real-time modes
* Simple BSDF model that is easy to extend
* Simple asset pipeline based on glTF 2.0 (support for a subset of glTF extensions including animation)
* NEE/visibility rays and importance sampling for environment maps with MIS
* Basic volumes and nested dielectrics with priority
* RayCone for texture MIP selection
* Basic analytic lights (directional, spot, point)
* [RTXDI](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/RTXDI) integration for ReSTIR DI (light importance sampling) and and ReSTIR GI (indirect lighting)
* [OMM](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Opacity-MicroMap-SDK) integration for fast ray traced alpha testing
* [NRD](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/RayTracingDenoiser) ReLAX and ReBLUR denoiser integration with up to 3-layer path space decomposition (Stable Planes)
* Reference mode 'photo-mode screenshot' with basic [OptiX denoiser](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix-denoiser) integration
* Basic TAA, tone mapping, etc.
* Streamline + DLSS integration


## Requirements

- Windows 10 20H1 (version 2004-10.0.19041) or newer
- DXR Capable GPU
- GeForce Game Ready Driver 531.18 or newer
- DirectX 12 or Vulkan API
- DirectX Raytracing 1.1 API, or higher
- Visual Studio 2019 or later with Windows 10 SDK version 10.0.20348.0 or later


## Known Issues

* Enabling Vulkan support requires a couple of manual steps, see [below](#building-vulkan)
* SER support on Vulkan is currently work in progress
* Using SER with DLSS3 Frame Generation is known to cause crashes in certain conditions in drivers older than version 536.99
* Running Vulkan on AMD GPUs may trigger a TDR during TLAS building in scenes with null TLAS instances
* We recommend using *NVIDIA Nsight Graphics* graphics for frame capture and analysis. If using other GPU performance tuning and debugging tools such as *PIX on Windows*, it is advisable to disable NVRHI_WITH_NVAPI and STREAMLINE_INTEGRATION variables in CMake to avoid compatibility issues. Please note: disabling these settings results in lower performance and missing features.

## Folder Structure

|						| |  
| -						| - |
| /bin					| default CMake folder for binaries and compiled shaders
| /build				| default CMake folder for build files
| /donut				| code for a custom version of the Donut framework  
| /donut/nvrhi			| code for the NVRHI rendering API layer (a git submodule)
| /external				| external libraries and SDKs, including NRD, RTXDI, and OMM
| /media				| models, textures, scene files  
| /tools				| optional command line tools (denoiser, texture compressor, etc)
| /pt_sdk				| **Path Tracing SDK core; Sample.cpp/.h/.hlsl contain entry points**
| /pt_sdk/PathTracer	| **Core path tracing shaders**


## Build

At the moment, only Windows builds are supported. We are going to add Linux support in the future.

1. Clone the repository **with all submodules recursively**:
   
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Path-Tracing-SDK.git`

2. Use CMake to configure the build and generate the project files.
   
   ```
   cd Path-Tracing-SDK
   cmake CMakeLists.txt -B ./build
   ```

   Use `-G "some tested VS version"` if specific Visual Studio or other environment version required. Make sure the x64 platform is used. 

3. Build the solution generated by CMake in the `./build/` folder.

   In example, if using Visual Studio, open the generated solution `build/PathTracingSDK.sln` and build it.

4. Select and run the `pt_sdk` project. Binaries get built to the `bin` folder. Media is loaded from `media` folder.

   If making a binary build, the `media` and `tools` folders can be placed into `bin` next to executable and packed up together (i.e. the sample app will search for both `media/` and `../media/`).


## Building Vulkan

Due to interaction with various included libraries, Vulkan support is not enabled by default and needs a couple of additional tweaks on the user side; please find the recommended steps below:
 * Install Vulkan SDK (we tested with 1.3.246.1 but others will work)
 * Set DONUT_WITH_VULKAN and NVRHI_WITH_VULKAN CMake variables to ON
 * Disable STREAMLINE_INTEGRATION (set CMake variable to OFF)
 * Clear CMake cache (if applicable) to make sure the correct dxc.exe path (from Vulkan SDK) is set for SPIRV compilation
 

 ## User Interface

Once the application is running, most of the SDK features can be accessed via the UI window on the left hand side and drop-down controls in the top-center. 

![UI](./images/r-ui.png)

Camera can be moved using W/S/A/D keys and rotated by dragging with the left mouse cursor.


## Command Line

- `--scene` loads a specific .scene.json file; example: `--scene programmer-art.scene.json`
- `--width` and `--height` to set the window size; example: `--width 3840 --height 2160`
- `--fullscreen` to start in full screen mode; example: `--width 3840 --height 2160 --fullscreen`
- `--adapter` to run on a specific GPU in multi GPU environments using a substring match; example: `--adapter A3000` will select an adapter with the full name `NVIDIA RTX A3000 Laptop GPU`
- `--debug` to enable the graphics API debug layer or runtime, and the [NVRHI](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/nvrhi) validation layer.
